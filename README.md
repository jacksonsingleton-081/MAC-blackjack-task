Hi,

My name is Jackson, I'm a first year IT/Commerce student.

I wish I could have produced a perfect version of this task and met all the requirements but unfortunately that was not the case.
If you test the code, you'll find the following missing:

- Round save history
- API AI assitance
- Card animations
- Probably some other things

Although it was my first time using JavaScript to code, and wasn't able to complete all the requirements, it was a good opportunity to work on a project that isn't apart of a unit or assignment, and also to begin learning a new langauge.

I would assume having an incomplete task is unfavoured in the selection process but this tryout process has been beneficial to me nonetheless.

Regards.
